# Vulkan Playground
During University we looked at using Vulkan, and despite being really interested in it, I realised over time I'd forgotten a lot about the technology, so I created this project as a way to re-learn and get familiar with Vulkan again.

Currently I'm just following the (Vulkan Tutorial)[https://vulkan-tutorial.com/], but eventually I'd like to branch out into more interesting projects once I'm comfurtable with the basics.
